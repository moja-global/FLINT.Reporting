Where SSL Files do not already exist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the server has no official key or certificate that has been signed by
a public CA, proceed as follows:

1. Navigate to the openssl scripts directory on the server:
   ::

     FLINT.Reporting/code/scripts/setup/environment/openssl

2. Invoke the generate keys and certificates script:
   ::

     bash generate.sh

3. Follow the wizards instructions.

.. note::
   Should you come across the following error: ``"Can't load /root/.rnd into RNG"``,
   please follow the Instructions below:

   -  Clear any file that might have been generated by the script:
      ``sudo rm /*.key && sudo rm /*.cnf && sudo rm /*.crt``
   -  Create the ``/root/.rnd`` file file: ``sudo touch /root/.rnd``
   -  Rerun the instructions above.
